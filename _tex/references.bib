  abstract = {Abstract               High-frequency ventilation (HFV) has been used as a respiratory support mode for neonates for over 30 years. HFV is characterized by delivering tidal volumes close to or less than the anatomical dead space. Both animal and clinical studies have shown that HFV can effectively restore lung function, and potentially limit ventilator-induced lung injury, which is considered an important risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Knowledge of how HFV works, how it influences cardiorespiratory physiology, and how to apply it in daily clinical practice has proven to be essential for its optimal and safe use. We will present important aspects of gas exchange, lung-protective concepts, clinical use, and possible adverse effects of HFV. We also discuss the study results on the use of HFV in respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants and respiratory failure in term neonates.

The use of HFV in daily clinical practice in lung recruitment, determination of the optimal continuous distending pressure and frequency, and typical side effects of HFV are discussed.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a critical period of brain structural reorganisation and maturation of cognitive abilities. This relatively late developmental reorganisation may be altered in individuals who were born preterm. METHODS: We carried out longitudinal neuropsychological testing in 94 very preterm individuals (VPT; before 33 weeks' gestation) and 44 term born individuals at mean ages of 15.3 years (adolescence) and 19.5 years (young adulthood). RESULTS: Full scale, verbal and performance IQ and phonological verbal fluency were significantly lower in the VPT group than the term group at both ages. Repeated measures ANOVA showed only one group by time point interaction for semantic verbal fluency (F = 10.25; df = 107; p = 0.002). Paired-sample t tests showed that semantic verbal fluency increased significantly in the term group over adolescence (t = -5.10; df = 42; p{$<$}0.001), but did not increase in the VPT group (t = 0.141; df = 69; p = 0.889). For verbal IQ, there was a significant interaction between time point and sex (F = 4.48; df = 1; p = 0.036) with paired-sample t tests showing that verbal IQ decreased in males between adolescence and adulthood (t = 3.35; df = 71; p = 0.001), but did not change significantly in females (t = 0.20; df = 52; p = 0.845). CONCLUSION: Decrements of intellectual functioning in VPT individuals persist into adulthood. Additionally, there is a deficit in the adolescent maturation of semantic verbal fluency in individuals born VPT.},

Although experimental data suggest that the newborn brain may be more resistant to ischemic injury than the adult brain, the minimum CBF necessary to sustain neuronal viability in newborn infants is unknown. We have measured CBF with positron emission tomography in 16 preterm and 14 term newborn infants and have determined the relationship between CBF and subsequent brain function as assessed by neurological examination and developmental assessment. The range of mean CBF in the preterm infants was 4.9 to 23 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) and the range of mean CBF in the term infants was 9.0 to 73 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min). Five preterm infants and one term infant with mean CBF less than 10 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) survived. Three of these 5 preterm infants, with mean CBF of 4.9, 5.2, and 9.3 ml/ (100 gm {$\cdot$} min, respectively, have normal neurological examinations and Bayley Scales of 80 or greater at 6, 6, and 24 months of age, respectively. One (mean CBF 6.9) has normal cognitive development (Bayley 103) and a mild spastic diplegia at age 19 months, and one infant (mean CBF 6.2) has a left hemiparesis and a Binet IQ score of 70 at age 33 months. The term infant, with a mean CBF of 9.0 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min), was developing normally when he died of Septembersis at age 5 months. These data indicate that mean CBF as low as 5 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) in newborn infants can be associated with normal subsequent neurological development and therefore with preservation of a substantial number of cortical/ neurons. Since the minimal CBF below this value necessary to maintain neuronal viability in newborn infants remains to be determined, measurements of CBF in the newborn period should not be used in determination of brain death.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A better understanding of the developmental changes in brain energy metabolism that occur in human neonates is critically important for designing rational treatment strategies that ensure an adequate supply of nutrients to the brain and minimize deleterious side effects of therapeutic interventions in sick newborns. METHODS: Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) was measured with positron emission tomography in 11 sick newborns of different gestational ages. RESULTS: In five preterm infants, mean hemispheric CMRO2 was 0.06 to 0.54 mL 100 g-1 min-1. Two of these preterm infants with virtually absent CMRO2 (0.06 mL 100 g-1 min-1) had minimal or no evidence of parenchymal brain injury detected in the newborn period. In six term infants, mean hemispheric CMRO2 was 0.0 to 1.3 mL 100 g-1 min-1. Two with no neurological disease had mean hemispheric CMRO2 of 0.4 and 0.7 mL 100 g-1 min-1 and were normal at 6 and 7 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CMRO2 in four newborns who had minimal or no detectable brain injury was considerably below the threshold for brain viability in adults of 1.3 mL 100 g-1 min-1. This indicates that energy requirements in fetal and newborn brain are minimal or can be met by nonoxidative metabolism.},

While numerous cognitive and neuropsychological outcome studies have been published, it is important to consider methodological issues when reviewing this research, as the generalizability of the studies varies greatly. This article describes the nature of cognitive difficulties confronting VP children, both in terms of the frequency and severity of deficits. The breadth of cognitive difficulties reported in this population implies a generalized cognitive impairment; however, the presence of selective or primary cognitive deficits is discussed. It is concluded that whereas mortality and neonatal morbidity rates have decreased significantly in VP infants in recent decades, these children continue to be at significant risk for cognitive impairments and need to be closely monitored throughout childhood.},

Neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhances the capacity to detect brain injury and altered brain development and assists in the prediction of high-risk children who warrant surveillance and early intervention. This review describes the application of conventional and advanced MRI with very preterm neonates, specifically focusing on the relationship between neonatal MRI findings and later neurodevelopmental outcome. Research demonstrates that conventional MRI is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental outcome in childhood. Further studies are needed to examine the role of advanced MRI techniques in predicting outcome in very preterm children, but early research findings are promising. In conclusion, neonatal MRI is predictive of later neurodevelopment but is dependent on appropriately trained specialists and should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and social information.},

AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the performance of very preterm, school-age children on three components of Executive Function (EF), two components of Executive Attention and a measure of IQ. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, independent samples comparison. METHODS: A UK sample of 40 very preterm ({$<$}32 weeks gestational age, Mean 28.43, SD 2.41) children and 41 term born control children aged between 6 and 12 years (mean ages 8 years 5 months in both groups) was assessed on IQ, EF (inhibition, working memory and set shifting) and attention (sustained and selective). Between group comparisons were made using multivariate analysis of variance and covariance. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses indicated that preterm children scored significantly lower than their term born peers across Executive Function and executive attention tasks. As expected, the preterm group achieved IQ scores at the low end of the average range. Univariate analyses indicated some difficulties with shifting and inhibition components of EF, although covariate analysis revealed that only shifting was independent of IQ. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm children showed mild executive function and executive attention difficulties in the context of average IQ scores. The findings highlight the benefit of using multivariate assessments of executive skills rather than general intellectual outcome alone, to obtain a better distinction of the specific cognitive weaknesses associated with preterm birth.},

While the techniques implemented presently provide important results for cognition and the neurosciences through their relative measures of HbR and HbT concentrations, there is much to be done to improve sensitivity, accuracy, and resolution. In this paper, we review the advances currently being made and issues to consider for improving optical image quality. These include the optimal selection of wavelengths to minimize random and systematic error propagation in the calculation of the hemoglobin concentrations, the filtering of systemic physiological signal clutter to improve sensitivity to the hemodynamic response to brain activation, the implementation of overlapping measurements to improve image spatial resolution and uniformity, and the utilization of spatial prior information from structural and functional MRI to reduce DOI partial volume error and improve image quantitative accuracy.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of synaptogenesis in the primary visual cortex (Brodmann's area 17) were analyzed by electron microscopy in 33 rhesus monkeys, ranging in age from the 50th embryonic day (E50) to 20 years. A series of overlapping electron micrographs (vertical probes) were examined at each age on sections of the upper bank of the calcarine fissure. Synaptic contacts were first observed in the E50 specimen in the subplate and marginal zone (prospective layer I). In the cortical plate itself, synapses appear between E65 and E89 starting in the prospective layer VI. By E112, after all cortical neurons have assumed their laminar positions, synapses situated predominantly on dendritic shafts were present at a low density throughout the full thickness of the cortical plate. Thereafter, synapses accumulate more rapidly on dendritic spines and by E144 an equal number of contacts are found on both spines and shafts. The density of synapses continues to increase exponentially in all layers and reaches the mean maximum density of about 90 synapses per 100 microns 3 of neuropil by the third postnatal month. During the next 2 postnatal years the density of synaptic contacts decreases only slightly to a mean of 80/100 microns 3 of neuropil. Around the time of puberty, however, synaptic density decreases more rapidly to reach the adult level of about 40--50/100 microns 3 of neuropil. The 40\% decrease in the density of synaptic contacts occurring between 2.7 and 5 years represents a loss of about 5000 synapses per second in the primary visual cortex of the two hemispheres, due primarily to the loss of asymmetric synapses situated on dendritic spines. The transient phase of high density of synaptic contacts located on dendrospines is shorter in thalamo-recipient layer IV than in either supra- or intragranular layers and is completed within the first postnatal year. It ends earlier in sublayer IVC than in layers IVAB and II-III, for example, reflecting biochemical and functional maturation of the different visual subsystems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Preterm infants have an increased risk of cognitive and behavioral deficits and cerebral palsy compared to term born babies. Especially before 32\,weeks of gestation, infants may require respiratory support, but at the same time, ventilation is known to induce oxidative stress, increasing the risk of brain injury. Ventilation may cause brain damage through two pathways: localized cerebral inflammatory response and hemodynamic instability. During ventilation, the most important causes of pro-inflammatory cytokine release are oxygen toxicity, barotrauma and volutrauma. The purpose of this review was to analyze the mechanism of ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and the relationship between brain injury and VILI in order to provide the safest possible respiratory support to a premature baby. As gentle ventilation from the delivery room is needed to reduce VILI, it is recommended to start ventilation with 21--30\% oxygen, prefer a non-invasive respiratory approach and, if mechanical ventilation is required, prefer low Positive End-Expiratory Pressure and tidal volume.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality sensitive to deoxyhemoglobin, is a promising method for measuring cerebral oxygenation in human neonates. Paramagnetic sources, like deoxyhemoglobin, however, can be obscured by diamagnetic sources such as water and myelin. This study evaluated whether QSM images, or isolated paramagnetic components, are more accurate for measuring oxygenation of cerebral veins of preterm neonates, and explored oxygenation differences between the major cerebral veins.                                         Methods                                19 preterm neonates were scanned on at term equivalent age on a 3T MRI using a multi-echo susceptibility-weighted imaging sequence. Susceptibility values were calculated from QSM images to determine oxygen saturation (SvO                 2                 ) in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and central cerebral veins (CCV). The paramagnetic components of QSM images were isolated, and SvO                 2                 values were recalculated.                                                        Results                                The mean SvO                 2                 values from QSM were 72.4\% (SD, 3.4\%) for the SSS and 68.7\% (SD, 3.5\%) for the CCV. SvO                 2                 values for paramagnetic components were 58.1\% (SD, 7.3\%) for the SSS and 57.7\% (SD, 7.0\%) for the CCV.                                                        Conclusion               While paramagnetic component decomposition yielded SSS values closer to those found in the literature, it increased variability. No significant oxygenation differences were found between the SSS and CCV, contrasting with prior studies.                                         Impact                                                                        This study evaluated the use of QSM and its paramagnetic components to measure cerebral oxygenation in neonates.                                                                                  By comparing susceptibility-derived oxygen saturation (SvO                       2                       ) in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and central cerebral veins (CCV), it adds to the field of neonatal cerebral oxygenation measurement.                                                                                                       Decomposing QSM into paramagnetic components shows potential for improving SvO                       2                       accuracy, particularly in the SSS, though variability remains a challenge.                                                                                The results suggest no significant oxygenation difference between the SSS and CCV, contrasting with previous findings, indicating a need for further research on neonatal venous oxygenation.},

HI brain injury evolves over hours to days, and involves complex interactions between the endogenous protective and pathological processes. Understanding the timing of evolution of injury is vital to guide treatment. Post-HI recovery is associated with a typical neurophysiological profile, with stereotypic changes in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. After the initial recovery, there is a delayed, prolonged reduction in cerebral perfusion related to metabolic suppression, followed by secondary deterioration with hyperperfusion and increased cerebral oxygenation, associated with altered neurovascular coupling and impaired cerebral autoregulation. These changes in cerebral perfusion are associated with the stages of evolution of injury and injury severity. Further, iatrogenic factors can also affect cerebral oxygenation during the early period of deranged metabolism, and improving clinical management may improve neuroprotection. We will review recent evidence that changes in cerebral oxygenation and metabolism after HI may be useful biomarkers of prognosis.},

Historically, the clinician has had little to offer neonates with HIE other than systemic supportive care. Recently, the neuroprotective therapy of hypothermia has emerged as the standard of care, and other complementary therapies are rapidly transitioning from the basic science to clinical care. OBJECTIVE: To examine the pathophysiology of HIE and the state of the art for the clinical care of neonates with HIE. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We performed a literature review using the PubMed database. Results focused on reviews and articles published from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014. Articles published earlier than 2004 were included when appropriate for historical perspective. Our review emphasized evidence-based management practices for the clinician. FINDINGS: A total of 102 articles for critical review were selected based on their relevance to the incidence of HIE, pathophysiology, neuroimaging, placental pathology, biomarkers, current systemic supportive care, hypothermia, and emerging therapies for HIE and were reviewed by both of us. Seventy-five publications were selected for inclusion in this article based on their relevance to these topics. The publications highlight the emergence of serum-based biomarkers, placental pathology, and magnetic resonance imaging as useful tools to predict long-term outcomes. Hypothermia and systemic supportive care form the cornerstone of therapy for HIE. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pathophysiology of HIE is now better understood, and treatment with hypothermia has become the foundation of therapy. Several neuroprotective agents offer promise when combined with hypothermia and are entering clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in neonatology have led to the increased survival of extremely low-birth weight infants. However, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not improved proportionally, partly due to increased survival of extremely premature infants born at the late-canalicular stage of lung development. Due to minimal surfactant production at this stage, these infants are at risk for severe respiratory distress syndrome, needing prolonged ventilation. While the etiology of BPD is multifactorial with antenatal, postnatal, and genetic factors playing a role, ventilator-induced lung injury is a major, potentially modifiable, risk factor implicated in its causation. Infants with BPD are at a higher risk of developing complications including sepsis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, respiratory failure, and death. Long-term problems include increased risk of hospital readmissions, respiratory infections, and asthma-like symptoms during infancy and childhood. Survivors who have BPD are also at increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. While the ultimate solution for avoiding BPD lies in the prevention of preterm births, strategies to decrease its incidence are the need of the hour. It is time to focus on gentler modes of ventilation and the use of less invasive surfactant administration techniques to mitigate lung injury, thereby potentially decreasing the burden of BPD. In this article, we discuss the use of non-invasive ventilation in premature infants, with an emphasis on studies showing an effect on BPD with different modes of non-invasive ventilation. Practical considerations in the use of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation are also discussed, considering the significant heterogeneity in clinical practices and management strategies in its use.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate acquisition and processing methods for quantitative oxygenation venograms that map in vivo oxygen saturation (SvO2 ) along cerebral venous vasculature. METHODS: Regularized quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is used to reconstruct susceptibility values and estimate SvO2 in veins. QSM with {$\ell$}1 and {$\ell$}2 regularization are compared in numerical simulations of vessel structures with known magnetic susceptibility. Dual-echo, flow-compensated phase images are collected in three healthy volunteers to create QSM images. Bright veins in the susceptibility maps are vectorized and used to form a three-dimensional vascular mesh, or venogram, along which to display SvO2 values from QSM. RESULTS: Quantitative oxygenation venograms that map SvO2 along brain vessels of arbitrary orientation and geometry are shown in vivo. SvO2 values in major cerebral veins lie within the normal physiological range reported by (15) O positron emission tomography. SvO2 from QSM is consistent with previous MR susceptometry methods for vessel segments oriented parallel to the main magnetic field. In vessel simulations, {$\ell$}1 regularization results in less than 10\% SvO2 absolute error across all vessel tilt orientations and provides more accurate SvO2 estimation than {$\ell$}2 regularization. CONCLUSION: The proposed analysis of susceptibility images enables reliable mapping of quantitative SvO2 along venograms and may facilitate clinical use of venous oxygenation imaging.},

In the resting state an excellent correlation (mean r, 0.87) between CBF and CMRO2 was found when paired measurements of CBF and CMRO2 from multiple (30-48) brain regions were tested in each of 33 normal subjects. Regional uncoupling of CBF and CMRO2 was found, however, during neuronal activation induced by somatosensory stimulation. Stimulus-induced focal augmentation of cerebral blood flow (29\% mean) far exceeded the concomitant local increase in tissue metabolic rate (mean, 5\%), when resting-state and stimulated-state measurements were obtained in each of 9 subjects. Stimulus duration had no significant effect on response magnitude or on the degree of CBF-CMRO2 uncoupling observed. Dynamic, physiological regulation of CBF by a mechanism (neuronal or biochemical) dependent on neuronal firing per se, but independent of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, is hypothesized.},

  abstract = {Premature birth is a significant cause of infant and child morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the premature birth rate, which had steadily increased during the 1990s and early 2000s, has decreased annually for 7 years and is now approximately 11.39\%. Human viability, defined as gestational age at which the chance of survival is 50\%, is currently approximately 23 to 24 weeks in developed countries. Infant girls, on average, have better outcomes than infant boys. A relatively uncomplicated course in the intensive care nursery for an extremely premature infant results in a discharge date close to the prenatal estimated date of confinement. Despite technological advances and efforts of child health experts during the last generation, the extremely premature infant (less than 28 weeks gestation) and extremely low birth weight infant ({$<$}1000 g) remain at high risk for death and disability with 30\% to 50\% mortality and, in survivors, at least 20\% to 50\% risk of morbidity. The introduction of continuous positive airway pressure, mechanical ventilation, and exogenous surfactant increased survival and spurred the development of neonatal intensive care in the 1970s through the early 1990s. Routine administration of antenatal steroids during premature labor improved neonatal mortality and morbidity in the late 1990s. The recognition that chronic postnatal administration of steroids to infants should be avoided may have improved outcomes in the early 2000s. Evidence from recent trials attempting to define the appropriate target for oxygen saturation in preterm infants suggests arterial oxygen saturation between 91\% and 95\% (compared with 85\%-89\%) avoids excess mortality; however, final analyses of data from these trials have not been published, so definitive recommendations are still pending. The development of neonatal neurocritical intensive care units may improve neurocognitive outcomes in this high-risk group. Long-term follow-up to detect and address developmental, learning, behavioral, and social problems is critical for children born at these early gestational ages.The striking similarities in response to extreme prematurity in the lung and brain imply that agents and techniques that benefit one organ are likely to also benefit the other. Finally, because therapy and supportive care continue to change, the outcomes of extremely low birth weight infants are ever evolving. Efforts to minimize injury, preserve growth, and identify interventions focused on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways are now being evaluated. Thus, treating and preventing long-term deficits must be developed in the context of a "moving target."},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

This suggests that subjects have an individual coupling between perfusion and metabolism and shows that absolute perfusion measurements does not serve as a surrogate measure of individual measures of oxygen metabolism.

Here, we investigated the between-subject and regional associations between CBF and CMRO               2               measures with independent and quantitative PET techniques. We included resting CBF and CMRO               2               measurements from 50 healthy volunteers (aged 22--81\,yr), and calculated the regional and global values of oxygen delivery (Do               2               ) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Linear mixed-model analysis showed that CBF and CMRO               2               measurements were closely associated regionally, but no significant between-subject association could be demonstrated, even when adjusting for arterial Pco               2               and hemoglobin concentration. The analysis also showed regional differences of OEF, reflecting variable relationship between Do               2               and CMRO               2               , resulting in lower estimates of OEF in thalami, brainstem, and mesial temporal cortices and higher estimates of OEF in occipital cortex. In the present study, we demonstrated no between-subject association of quantitative measurements of CBF and CMRO               2               in healthy subjects. Thus, quantitative measurements of CBF did not reflect the underlying between-subject variability of oxygen metabolism measures, mainly because of large interindividual OEF variability not accounted for by Pco               2               and hemoglobin concentration.

RESULTS: CBF and CMRO2 in the visual cortex were significantly higher than those in other cortices. Additionally, OEF in the sensorimotor cortex was significantly lower than that in other cortical regions. CONCLUSION: CBF and CMRO2 in the visual cortex are always high, and low OEF in the sensorimotor cortex exists even in resting state in normal subjects. We hypothesize that these regional functional differences would result in different resistances to degeneration.},

  abstract = {Neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with altered cerebral hemodynamics and increased risk of brain injury. Two novel noninvasive techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies (diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)), were employed to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO(2)) of 32 anesthetized CHD neonates at rest and during hypercapnia. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation (S(v)O(2)) and CBF were measured simultaneously with MRI in the superior sagittal sinus, yielding global oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and global CMRO(2) in physiologic units. In addition, microvascular tissue oxygenation (StO(2)) and indices of microvascular CBF (BFI) and CMRO(2) (CMRO(2)(i)) in the frontal cortex were determined by DOS/DCS. Median resting-state MRI-measured OEF, CBF, and CMRO(2) were 0.38, 9.7\,mL/minute per 100\,g and 0.52\,mL O(2)/minute per 100\,g, respectively. These CBF and CMRO(2) values are lower than literature reports for healthy term neonates (which are sparse and quantified using different methods) and resemble values reported for premature infants. Comparison of MRI measurements of global S(v)O(2), CBF, and CMRO(2) with corresponding local DOS/DCS measurements demonstrated strong linear correlations (R(2)=0.69, 0.67, 0.67; P{$<$}0.001), permitting calibration of DOS/DCS indices. The results suggest that MRI and optics offer new tools to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in CHD neonates.},

Most applications of hypercapnia are based on the assumption that a mild increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide has negligible effect on cerebral metabolism. In this study, we sought to further investigate the vascular and metabolic effects of hypercapnia by simultaneously measuring global venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and total cerebral blood flow (tCBF), with a temporal resolution of 30 seconds using magnetic resonance susceptometry and phase-contrast techniques in 10 healthy awake adults. While significant increases in SvO2 and tCBF were observed during hypercapnia (P {$<$} 0.005), no change in CMRO2 was noted (P {$>$} 0.05). Additionally, fractional changes in tCBF and end-tidal carbon dioxide (R2 = 0.72, P {$<$} 0.005), as well as baseline SvO2 and tCBF (R2 = 0.72, P {$<$} 0.005), were found to be correlated. The data also suggested a correlation between cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR) and baseline tCBF (R2 = 0.44, P = 0.052). A CVR value of 6.1\% {\textpm} 1.6\%/mm Hg was determined using a linear-fit model.

Thereby, QSM can reveal pathological changes of these key components in a variety of diseases. QSM requires multiple processing steps such as phase unwrapping, background field removal and field-to-source-inversion. Current state of the art techniques utilize iterative optimization procedures to solve the inversion and background field correction, which are computationally expensive and require a careful choice of regularization parameters. With the recent success of deep learning using convolutional neural networks for solving ill-posed reconstruction problems, the QSM community also adapted these techniques and demonstrated that the QSM processing steps can be solved by efficient feed forward multiplications not requiring iterative optimization nor the choice of regularization parameters. Here, we review the current status of deep learning based approaches for processing QSM, highlighting limitations and potential pitfalls, and discuss the future directions the field may take to exploit the latest advances in deep learning for QSM.},

  abstract = {Supportive care with mechanical ventilation continues to be an essential strategy for managing severe neonatal respiratory failure; however, it is well known to cause and accentuate neonatal lung injury. The pathogenesis of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is multifactorial and complex, resulting predominantly from interactions between ventilator-related factors and patient-related factors. Importantly, VILI is a significant risk factor for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common chronic respiratory morbidity of preterm infants that lacks specific therapies, causes life-long morbidities, and imposes psychosocial and economic burdens. Studies of older children and adults suggest that understanding how and why VILI occurs is essential to developing strategies for mitigating VILI and its consequences. This article reviews the preclinical and clinical evidence on the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of VILI in neonates. We also highlight the evidence behind various lung-protective strategies to guide clinicians in preventing and attenuating VILI and, by extension, BPD in neonates. Further, we provide a snapshot of future directions that may help minimize neonatal VILI.},

Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2006, we prospectively enrolled 310 live-born infants between 23 and 32 weeks of gestation. The association between candidate risk factors and delayed motor or mental development (Bayley Scales of infant development II; psychomotor or mental developmental index {$<$}85) was analysed by means of logistic regression analysis.             Results: Two hundred and fifty infants were eligible for follow-up, and 205 (82.0\%) completed the follow-up visit. Intracerebral haemorrhage, small for gestational age and late-onset sepsis were associated with an increased risk for delayed development in Group I (p{$\quad<\quad$}0.05, each). Premature rupture of membranes was a risk condition relevant to Group II. Antenatal steroids were associated with a decreased risk of neurodevelopmental delay in both groups.             Conclusion: This study identified distinct risk factors for adverse outcome in preterm infants of lower ({$<$}30 weeks) and higher (30--32 weeks) gestational age. In the lower gestational age group, neonatal risk predictors are most important. Antenatal steroids appear to decrease the risk for adverse outcome in both age groups.},

METHODS: We compared outcomes of extremely low birth weight ({$<$}1 kg) and extremely low gestational age ({$<$}28 weeks) infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia between 2 periods (period I, 1996-1999: extremely low birth weight, n = 122; extremely low gestational age, n = 118; period II, 2000-2003: extremely low birth weight, n = 109; extremely low gestational age, n = 107). RESULTS: For both groups, significant practice changes between period I and period II included increased prenatal and decreased postnatal steroid therapy and increased surfactant therapy, indomethacin therapy, and patent ductus arteriosus ligation. Significant morbidity changes included decreased rates of severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities and increased rates of ventilator dependence. Rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia did not change (52\% vs 53\%). Follow-up evaluation revealed significantly lower rates of neurosensory abnormalities during period II (extremely low birth weight: 29\% vs 16\%; extremely low gestational age: 31\% vs 16\%). There were no changes in rates of Mental Developmental Index scores of {$<$}70 (extremely low birth weight: 42\% vs 42\%; extremely low gestational age: 37\% vs 45\%) or overall developmental impairment (extremely low birth weight: 51\% vs 49\%; extremely low gestational age: 50\% vs 51\%). For the extremely low gestational age group, predictors of neurosensory abnormalities were severe cranial ultrasound abnormality and postnatal steroid therapy. Predictors of overall impairment included severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities, ventilator dependence, postnatal steroid therapy, and patent ductus arteriosus ligation. For the extremely low birth weight group, the only predictor of neurosensory abnormalities was severe cranial ultrasound abnormality. Predictors of overall impairment included multiple birth, ventilator dependence, and severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosensory outcomes of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia improved during 2000 to 2003 but overall neurodevelopmental outcomes did not change.},

  abstract = {Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with mortality rates as high as 50\% in children with severe PARDS. Despite this, pediatric lung injury and mechanical ventilation has been poorly studied, with the majority of investigations being observational or retrospective and with only a few randomized controlled trials to guide intensivists. The most recent and universally accepted guidelines for pediatric lung injury are based on consensus opinion rather than objective data. Therefore, most neonatal and pediatric mechanical ventilation practices have been arbitrarily adapted from adult protocols, neglecting the differences in lung pathophysiology, response to injury, and co-morbidities among the three groups. Low tidal volume ventilation has been generally accepted for pediatric patients, even in the absence of supporting evidence. No target tidal volume range has consistently been associated with outcomes, and compliance with delivering specific tidal volume ranges has been poor. Similarly, optimal PEEP has not been well-studied, with a general acceptance of higher levels of F                                i                              O               2               and less aggressive PEEP titration as compared with adults. Other modes of ventilation including airway pressure release ventilation and high frequency ventilation have not been studied in a systematic fashion and there is too little evidence to recommend supporting or refraining from their use. There have been no consistent outcomes among studies in determining optimal modes or methods of setting them. In this review, the studies performed to date on mechanical ventilation strategies in neonatal and pediatric populations will be analyzed. There may not be a single optimal mechanical ventilation approach, where the best method may simply be one that allows for a personalized approach with settings adapted to the individual patient and disease pathophysiology. The challenges and barriers to conducting well-powered and robust multi-institutional studies will also be addressed, as well as reconsidering outcome measures and study design.},

Comparison of growth parameters derived from a sample of 161 normative male brains collected at the Department of Neuroanatomy of the Medical School in Hannover revealed an ideal weight of 1,353 g (SD = 14), a half value time of 401 (SD = 10) ontogenetic days and a growth factor of 4.0 (SD = 0.2). The minor discrepancies in the corresponding parameters reflect the small sample size and a considerable lack of developmental data of the three first postnatal decades in the material derived from the Yakovlev Collection. It was, therefore, deemed necessary to analyze these data in combination with data derived from other sources of human material. A comparison of human with animal growth parameters derived from mice, cats and tree shrews reveals differences in brain development. Histological shrinkage of the 25 male brains of the Yakovlev Collection related to fixation, embedding, and staining was assessed. Fetal brains shrank by about 75\%, and adult brains by about 50\%. The degree of shrinkage was inversely proportional to the age of the brain and was also characterized by individual variations of up to 20\%. Therefore, shrinkage had to be corrected on an individual basis in order to determine the true growth of brain regions as reflected by morphometric analysis of histological serial sections.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing survival rates of children who are born very preterm raise issues about the risks of neurological disabilities and cognitive dysfunction. We aimed to investigate neurodevelopmental outcome and use of special health care at 5 years of age in a population-based cohort of very preterm children. METHODS: We included all 2901 livebirths between 22 and 32 completed weeks of gestation from nine regions in France in Jan 1-Dec 31, 1997, and a reference group of 667 children from the same regions born at 39-40 weeks of gestation. At 5 years of age, children had a medical examination and a cognitive assessment with the Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC), with scores on the mental processing composite (MPC) scale recorded. Data for health-care use were collected from parents. Severe disability was defined as non-ambulatory cerebral palsy, MPC score less than 55, or severe visual or hearing deficiency; moderate deficiency as cerebral palsy walking with aid or MPC score of 55-69; and minor disability as cerebral palsy walking without aid, MPC score of 70-84, or visual deficit ({$<$}3/10 for one eye). FINDINGS: In total, 1817 (77\%) of the 2357 surviving children born very preterm had a medical assessment at 5 years and 396 (60\%) of 664 in the reference group. Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 159 (9\%) of children born very preterm. Scores for MPC were available for 1534 children born very preterm: 503 (32\%) had an MPC score less than 85 and 182 (12\%) had an MPC score less than 70. Of the 320 children in the reference group, the corresponding values were 37 (12\%) and 11 (3\%), respectively. In the very preterm group, 83 (5\%) had severe disability, 155 (9\%) moderate disability, and 398 (25\%) minor disability. Disability was highest in children born at 24-28 completed weeks of gestation (195 children [49\%]), but the absolute number of children with disabilities was higher for children born at 29-32 weeks (441 children [36\%]). Special health-care resources were used by 188 (42\%) of children born at 24-28 weeks and 424 (31\%) born at 29-32 weeks, compared with only 63 (16\%) of those born at 39-40 weeks. INTERPRETATION: In children who are born very preterm, cognitive and neuromotor impairments at 5 years of age increase with decreasing gestational age. Many of these children need a high level of specialised care. Prevention of the learning disabilities associated with cognitive deficiencies in this group is an important goal for modern perinatal care for children who are born very preterm and for their families.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This is the first of seven articles from a preterm birth and stillbirth report. Presented here is an overview of the burden, an assessment of the quality of current estimates, review of trends, and recommendations to improve data. PRETERM BIRTH: Few countries have reliable national preterm birth prevalence data. Globally, an estimated 13 million babies are born before 37 completed weeks of gestation annually. Rates are generally highest in low- and middle-income countries, and increasing in some middle- and high-income countries, particularly the Americas. Preterm birth is the leading direct cause of neonatal death (27\%); more than one million preterm newborns die annually. Preterm birth is also the dominant risk factor for neonatal mortality, particularly for deaths due to infections. Long-term impairment is an increasing issue. STILLBIRTH: Stillbirths are currently not included in Millennium Development Goal tracking and remain invisible in global policies. For international comparisons, stillbirths include late fetal deaths weighing more than 1000g or occurring after 28 weeks gestation. Only about 2\% of all stillbirths are counted through vital registration and global estimates are based on household surveys or modelling. Two global estimation exercises reached a similar estimate of around three million annually; 99\% occur in low- and middle-income countries. One million stillbirths occur during birth. Global stillbirth cause-of-death estimates are impeded by multiple, complex classification systems. RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE DATA: (1) increase the capture and quality of pregnancy outcome data through household surveys, the main data source for countries with 75\% of the global burden; (2) increase compliance with standard definitions of gestational age and stillbirth in routine data collection systems; (3) strengthen existing data collection mechanisms--especially vital registration and facility data--by instituting a standard death certificate for stillbirth and neonatal death linked to revised International Classification of Diseases coding; (4) validate a simple, standardized classification system for stillbirth cause-of-death; and (5) improve systems and tools to capture acute morbidity and long-term impairment outcomes following preterm birth. CONCLUSION: Lack of adequate data hampers visibility, effective policies, and research. Immediate opportunities exist to improve data tracking and reduce the burden of preterm birth and stillbirth.},

However, the extent of these neuroanatomical deficits and the relation among these measures in middle childhood, a critical developmental period, have not been determined. We assessed differences in brain structure by acquiring high-resolution T(1)-weighted scans in 25 children born very preterm ({$<$}32 weeks gestational age) without significant post-natal neurological sequelae and 32 age-matched term-born children (7-10 years). Children born very preterm had decreased brain volume, surface area and cortical thickness compared to term-born children. Furthermore, children born preterm did not display the robust relation between total brain volume and basal ganglia and thalamic volume apparent in the term-born children. Cortical thickness analyses revealed that the cortex was thinner for children born preterm than term-born children in the anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area, isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, right superior temporal sulcus, right anterior insula, postcentral gyrus and precuneus. Follow-up analyses revealed that right precuneus thickness was correlated with gestational age. Thus, even without significant postnatal medical sequelae, very preterm-born children showed atypical brain structure and developmental patterns in areas related to higher cognitive function. Disruptions of the typical neurodevelopmental trajectory in the third trimester of pregnancy likely underlie these differences persisting into middle childhood.},

STUDY DESIGN: We studied 106 children (M = 10 years 1 month, SD = 16 months; 40 females) enrolled in primary school: 57 were healthy very preterm children (10 children born 24-27 completed weeks' gestation (extremely preterm), 14 children born 28-29 completed weeks' gestation, 19 children born 30-31 completed weeks' gestation (very preterm), and 14 born 32 completed weeks' gestation (moderately preterm)) all born appropriate for GA (AGA) and 49 term-born children. Neuroimaging involved voxel-based morphometry with the statistical parametric mapping software. Cognitive functions were assessed with the WISC-IV. General Linear Models and multiple regressions were conducted controlling age, sex, and maternal education. RESULTS: Compared to groups of children born 30 completed weeks' gestation and later, children born {$<$}28 completed weeks' gestation had less gray matter volume (GMV) and white matter volume (WMV) and poorer cognitive functions including decreased full scale IQ, and processing speed. Differences in GMV partially mediated the relationship between GA and full scale IQ in preterm born children. CONCLUSIONS: In preterm children who are born AGA and without major complications GA is associated with brain volume and cognitive functions. In particular, decreased brain volume becomes evident in the extremely preterm group (born {$<$}28 completed weeks' gestation). In preterm children born 30 completed weeks' gestation and later the relationship of GA with brain volume and cognitive functions may be less strong as previously thought.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical imaging data are typically stored and transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community. Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some variations can disrupt this process. NEW METHOD: We provide some insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First, different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion. Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the DICOM conversion. RESULTS: We present results in several error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction, effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry correction for some imaging modality. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Conversion tools are often designed for a specific manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities. CONCLUSIONS: The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This also serves as an overview for developers who wish to either develop their own tools or adapt the open source tools created by the authors.},

  abstract = {The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is the rate of oxygen consumption by the brain, and is thought to be a direct index of energy homeostasis and brain health. However, in vivo measurement of CMRO2 is challenging, in particular for the neonatal population, in whom conventional radiotracer methods are not applicable because of safety concerns. In this study, we propose a method to quantify global CMRO2 in neonates based on arteriovenous differences in oxygen content, and employ separate measurements of oxygenation and cerebral blood flow (CBF) parameters. Specifically, arterial and venous oxygenation levels were determined with pulse oximetry and the novel T2 relaxation under spin tagging (TRUST) MRI, respectively. Global CBF was measured with phase contrast (PC) flow velocity MRI. The proposed method was implemented on a standard 3-T MRI scanner without the need for any exogenous tracers, and the total scan duration was less than 5\,min. We demonstrated the feasibility of this method in 12 healthy neonates within an age range of 35-42 gestational weeks. CMRO2 values were successfully obtained from 10 neonates. It was found that the average CMRO2 in this age range was 38.3\,{\textpm}\,17.7\,{\textmu}mol/100\,g/min and was positively correlated with age (p\,=\,0.007; slope, 5.2\,{\textmu}mol/100\,g/min per week), although the highest CMRO2 value in this age range was still less than half of the adult level. Test-retest studies showed a coefficient of variation of 5.8\,{\textpm}\,2.2\% between repeated CMRO2 measurements. In addition, given the highly variable blood flow velocity within this age range, it is recommended that the TRUST labeling thickness and position should be determined on a subject-by-subject basis, and an automatic algorithm was developed for this purpose. Although this method provides a global CMRO2 measure only, the clinical significance of an energy consumption marker and the convenience of this technique may make it a useful tool in the functional assessment of the neonatal population.},

  abstract = {Recently, a T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI technique was developed to quantitatively estimate blood oxygen saturation fraction (Y) via the measurement of pure blood T2. This technique has shown promise for normalization of fMRI signals, for the assessment of oxygen metabolism, and in studies of cognitive aging and multiple sclerosis. However, a human validation study has not been conducted. In addition, the calibration curve used to convert blood T2 to Y has not accounted for the effects of hematocrit (Hct). In this study, we first conducted experiments on blood samples under physiologic conditions, and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill T2 was determined for a range of Y and Hct values. The data were fitted to a two-compartment exchange model to allow the characterization of a three-dimensional plot that can serve to calibrate the in vivo data. Next, in a validation study in humans, we showed that arterial Y estimated using TRUST MRI was 0.837 {\textpm} 0.036 (N=7) during the inhalation of 14\% O2, which was in excellent agreement with the gold-standard Y values of 0.840 {\textpm} 0.036 based on Pulse-Oximetry. These data suggest that the availability of this calibration plot should enhance the applicability of T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging MRI for noninvasive assessment of cerebral blood oxygenation.

  abstract = {Noninvasive measurement of cerebral venous oxygenation can serve as a tool for better understanding fMRI signals and for clinical evaluation of brain oxygen homeostasis. In this study a novel technique, T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI, is developed to estimate oxygenation in venous vessels. This method uses the spin labeling principle to automatically isolate pure blood signals from which T2 relaxation times are determined using flow-insensitive T2-preparation pulses. The blood T2 is then converted to blood oxygenation using a calibration plot. In vivo experiments gave a baseline venous oxygenation of 64.8 {\textpm} 6.3\% in sagittal sinus in healthy volunteers (n = 24). Reproducibility studies demonstrated that the standard deviation across trials was 2.0 {\textpm} 1.1\%. The effects of repetition time and inversion time selections were investigated. The TRUST technique was further tested using various physiologic challenges. Hypercapnia induced an increase in venous oxygenation by 13.8 {\textpm} 1.1\%. On the other hand, caffeine ingestion resulted in a decrease in oxygenation by 7.0 {\textpm} 1.8\%. Contrast agent infusion (Gd-DTPA, 0.1 mmol/kg) reduced venous blood T2 by 11.2 ms. The results of this study show that TRUST MRI is a useful technique for quantitative assessment of blood oxygenation in the brain.

  abstract = {The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) seeks to create the first 4-dimensional connectome of early life. Understanding this connectome in detail may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. Following established best practices adopted by the WU-MINN Human Connectome Project (HCP), and pioneered by FreeSurfer, the project utilises cortical surface-based processing pipelines. In this paper, we propose a fully automated processing pipeline for the structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the developing neonatal brain. This proposed pipeline consists of a refined framework for cortical and sub-cortical volume segmentation, cortical surface extraction, and cortical surface inflation, which has been specifically designed to address considerable differences between adult and neonatal brains, as imaged using MRI. Using the proposed pipeline our results demonstrate that images collected from 465 subjects ranging from 28 to 45 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) can be processed fully automatically; generating cortical surface models that are topologically correct, and correspond well with manual evaluations of tissue boundaries in 85\% of cases. Results improve on state-of-the-art neonatal tissue segmentation models and significant errors were found in only 2\% of cases, where these corresponded to subjects with high motion. Downstream, these surfaces will enhance comparisons of functional and diffusion MRI datasets, supporting the modelling of emerging patterns of brain connectivity.},

  abstract = {Preterm birth is a major public-health issue because of its increasing incidence combined with the frequent occurrence of subsequent behavioral, neurological, and psychiatric challenges faced by surviving infants. Approximately 10-15\% of very preterm children (born{$<$}30 weeks gestational age) develop cerebral palsy, and 30-60\% of them experience cognitive impairments. These adverse outcomes are related to a confluence of abnormal brain development along with white (WM) and gray matter (GM) injury sustained during the neonatal period. It is becoming apparent that the extra-uterine environment during this critical period (24-40 weeks gestation) in brain development has a profound and long lasting impact on the premature infant. Magnetic resonance imaging in the neonatal period and infancy provides a non-invasive, "in vivo" assessment of brain development and extent of brain injury. This not only helps understand the extent and timing of injury but also identifies infants who may benefit from early intervention to minimize the impact of the injury. LEARNING OUTCOMES: Readers will be able to (1) appreciate the diverse impact of prematurity on neurodevelopmental outcome, (2) recognize the biological vulnerability of the developing brain in premature infants born between 24 and 40 weeks of gestation, (3) understand the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool to detect abnormal development and brain injury in premature infants, and (4) see the potential role for novel MR imaging methods as biomarkers for brain development and injury in premature infants.},

Antenatal corticosteroids accelerate fetal lung maturation by increasing the activity of enzymes responsible for surfactant biosynthesis, resulting in improved lung compliance. Maternal antenatal corticosteroid treatment has improved survival of preterm neonates and lowered the incidence of brain injury. After birth, exogenous surfactant administration improves lung compliance and oxygenation, resulting in reductions in the incidence of pneumothorax and of death.

Here we studied cortical thickness in very preterm born individuals and controls in mid-adolescence (mean age 15 years) and beginning of adulthood (mean age 20 years), as well as longitudinal changes between the two time points. Using univariate approaches, we showed both increases and decreases in cortical thickness in very preterm born individuals compared to controls. Specifically (1) very preterm born adolescents displayed extensive areas of greater cortical thickness, especially in occipitotemporal and prefrontal cortices, differences which decreased substantially by early adulthood; (2) at both time points, very preterm-born participants showed smaller cortical thickness, especially in parahippocampal and insular regions. We then employed a multivariate approach (support vector machine) to study spatially discriminating features between the two groups, which achieved a mean accuracy of 86.5\%. The spatially distributed regions in which cortical thickness best discriminated between the groups (top 5\%) included temporal, occipitotemporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Within these spatially distributed regions (top 1\%), longitudinal changes in cortical thickness in left temporal pole, right occipitotemporal gyrus and left superior parietal lobe were significantly associated with scores on language-based tests of executive function. These results describe alterations in cortical thickness development in preterm-born individuals in their second decade of life, with implications for high-order cognitive processing.},

These measures can be grouped into the categories of pathogenesis, impairment, and functional limitation. Neuroimaging techniques are the most predictive measures of pathogenesis of cerebral palsy in both the preterm and term infant. Measures of neurological impairment focusing on muscle tone, reflexes, and other features of the neurological examination are poorly predictive in the first months of life. Detection of functional limitations manifested by motor developmental delay is sensitive and specific for later cerebral palsy, but not until well into the second 6 months of life. Abnormal spontaneous general movements in the infant 16 to 20 weeks postterm and earlier reflect functional limitations in the first months of life and have been shown to predict later cerebral palsy. Recognition of abnormal spontaneous general movements may improve early detection and diagnosis of cerebral palsy if these techniques can be successfully incorporated into organized follow-up programs and developmental surveillance.},

The method is based on the acquisition of a train of multiple images following the labeling scheme. Perfusion is obtained using deconvolution in a manner similar to that of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI. Local arterial input functions (AIFs) can be estimated by subtracting two perfusion-weighted images acquired with and without crusher gradients, respectively. Furthermore, by knowing the duration of the bolus of tagged arterial blood, one can estimate the aBV on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The maximum of the residue function obtained from the deconvolution of the tissue curve by the AIF is a measure of CBF after scaling by the locally estimated aBV. This method provides averaged gray matter (GM) perfusion values of 38 {\textpm} 2 ml/min/100 g and aBV of 0.93\% {\textpm} 0.06\%. The average CBF value is 10\% smaller than that obtained on the same data set using the standard general kinetic model (42 {\textpm} 2 ml/min/100 g). Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare this new methodology with parametric fitting by the conventional model. Magn Reson Med, 2006. {\copyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk of cerebral palsy, the commonest physical disability of children in western Europe, is higher in infants of very low birthweight (VLBW)--those born weighing less than 1500 g--and those from multiple pregnancies than in infants of normal birthweight. An increasing proportion of infants from both of these groups survive into childhood. This paper describes changes in the frequency and distribution of cerebral palsy by sex and neurological subtype in infants with a birthweight below 1000 g and 1000-1499 g in the period 1980-96. METHODS: A group of 16 European centres, Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe, agreed a standard definition of cerebral palsy and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data for children with cerebral palsy born in the years 1980-96 were pooled. The data were analysed to describe the distribution and prevalence of cerebral palsy in VLBW infants. Prevalence trends were expressed as both per 1000 livebirths and per 1000 neonatal survivors. FINDINGS: There were 1575 VLBW infants born with cerebral palsy; 414 (26\%) were of birthweight less than 1000 g and 317 (20\%) were from multiple pregnancies. 1426 (94\%) had spastic cerebral palsy, which was unilateral (hemiplegic) in 336 (24\%). The birth prevalence fell from 60.6 (99\%CI 37.8-91.4) per 1000 liveborn VLBW infants in 1980 to 39.5 (28.6-53.0) per 1000 VLBW infants in 1996. This decline was related to a reduction in the frequency of bilateral spastic cerebral palsy among infants of birthweight 1000-1499 g. The frequency of cerebral palsy was higher in male than female babies in the group of birthweight 1000-1499 g (61.0 [53.8-68..2] vs 49.5 [42.8-56.2] per 1000 livebirths; p=0.0025) but not in the group of birthweight below 1000 g. INTERPRETATION: These data from a large population base provide evidence that the prevalence of cerebral palsy in children of birthweight less than 1500 g has fallen, which has important implications for parents, health services, and society.},

Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to perform regional measurements in 50 subjects with varying degrees of cerebral ischemia but no evidence of infarction. There were 24 normal subjects, 24 subjects with arteriographic evidence of vascular disease of the carotid system, and two subjects with reversible ischemic neurological deficits due to cerebral vasospasm. Minimum values found in the 48 subjects with normal neurological function were 19 ml/100 g-min for regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and 1.3 ml/100 g-min for regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO               2               ). Minimum values for all 50 subjects with viable cerebral tissue were 15 ml/100 g-min for rCBF and 1.3 ml/100 g-min for rCMRO               2               . Comparison of these measurements with values from 20 areas of established cerebral infarction in 10 subjects demonstrated that 80\% (16/20) of infarcted regions had rCMRO               2               values below the lower normal limit of 1.3 ml/100g-min. Measurements of rCBF, regional cerebral blood volume, and oxygen extraction fraction were less useful for distinguishing viable from infarcted tissue. These data indicate that quantitative regional measurements of rCMRO               2               with PET accurately distinguish viable from nonviable cerebral tissue and may be useful in the prospective identification of patients with reversible ischemia.},

  abstract = {The brain's hemodynamic and metabolism of punctate white matter lesions (PWML) is poorly understood due to a scarcity of non-invasive imaging techniques. The aim of this study was to apply new MRI techniques to quantify cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), global cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation fractions in venous blood (Yv) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in neonates with PWML, for better understanding of the pathophysiology of PWML. Fifty-one newborns were recruited continuously, including 23 neonatal patients with PWML and 28 normal control neonates. Phase-contrast (PC) MRI and T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI were performed for the measurement of CBF and Yv. OEF and CMRO2 were calculated from the CBF and Yv values. The total maturation score (TMS) was assessed for each neonate on standard T1, 2-weighted images to evaluate cerebral maturation. The CMRO2, CBF, Yv, and OEF values were compared between groups, and their associations with age and TMS were evaluated. Significant differences between PWML group and control group were found in CMRO2 (P = 0.020), CBF (P = 0.027), Yv (P = 0.012), OEF (P = 0.018). After age/maturation is accounted for, Yv and OEF showed significant dependence on the groups (P {$<$} 0.05). Newborns with PWML had lower OEF and higher Yv. CMRO2, CBF and brain volume were correlated with age (P {$<$} 0.001) and TMS (P {$<$} 0.05). It is feasible to use non-invasive MRI methods to measure cerebral oxygen supply and consumption in neonates with PWML. Newborns with PWML have lower oxygen consumption. Yv and OEF may be helpful for the diagnosis of PWML. The positive correlation between CBF and TMS, and between CMRO2 and TMS suggested that as myelination progresses, the blood supply and oxygen metabolism in the brain increase to meet the escalating energy demand.},

Design               Systematic review and network meta-analysis using the Bayesian random-effects approach. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched.                                         Interventions               High flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel CPAP (BiPAP), noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).                                         Main Outcome Measures               Requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), any treatment failure.                                         Results               A total of 35 studies including 4078 neonates were included. NIPPV was more effective in decreasing the requirement of MV than CPAP (risk ratios [95\% credible interval]: 0.60 [0.44, 0.77]) and HFNC [0.66 (0.43, 0.97)]. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for NIPPV, BiPAP, HFNC, and CPAP were 0.95, 0.59, 0.32, and 0.13. For the outcome of treatment failure, both NIPPV and BiPAP were more efficacious compared to CPAP and HFNC (0.56 [0.44, 0.71] \{NIPPV vs CPAP\}, 0.69 [0.51, 0.93] \{BiPAP vs CPAP\}, 0.42 [0.30, 0.63] \{NIPPV vs HFNC\}, 0.53 [0.35, 0.81] \{BiPAP vs HFNC\}). The SUCRA for NIPPV, BiPAP, CPAP, and HFNC were 0.96, 0.70, 0.32, and 0.01. NIPPV was associated with a reduced risk of air leak compared to BiPAP and CPAP (0.36 [0.16, 0.73]; 0.54 [0.30, 0.87], respectively). NIPPV resulted in lesser incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality when compared to CPAP (0.74 [0.52, 0.98]). Nasal injury was lesser with HFNC compared to CPAP (0.15 [0.01, 0.60]).                                         Conclusions               Most effective primary mode of NRS in preterm neonates with RDS was NIPPV.},

Results                                The ELGANs with later WM abnormalities exhibited lower SpO                 2                 and pO                 2                 levels, and higher FiO                 2                 need during the first 3 days than those with normal WM. They also had higher pCO                 2                 values. The infants with abnormal MEG-SII showed opposite findings, i.e., displayed higher SpO                 2                 and pO                 2                 levels and lower FiO                 2                 need, than those with better outcomes. Severe WM changes and abnormal MEG-SII were correlated with adverse neurodevelopment.                                                        Conclusions                                Low oxygen levels and high FiO                 2                 need during the NICU care associate with WM abnormalities, whereas higher oxygen levels correlate with abnormal MEG-SII. The results may indicate certain brain structures being more vulnerable to hypoxia and others to hyperoxia, thus emphasizing the role of strict saturation targets.                                                        Impact                                                                        This study indicates that both abnormally low and high oxygen levels during early NICU care are harmful for later neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm neonates.                                                           Specific brain structures seem to be vulnerable to low and others to high oxygen levels.                                                           The findings may have clinical implications as oxygen is one of the most common therapies given in NICUs.

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to evaluate the near infrared spectroscopy technique for determination of the cerebral venous oxygen saturation. By tilting the patient's head down 15 degrees, changes in OD may be caused by changes in cerebral blood volume. On the assumption that increases in cerebral blood volume consist of venous blood only, cerebral venous oxygen saturation can be calculated as the measured change in oxygenated Hb divided by the change in total Hb. Two groups of mechanically ventilated, newborn infants were investigated: 10 asphyxiated, term infants and another 22 preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. All were monitored by near infrared spectroscopy during tilting, and cerebral blood flow was estimated by the 133Xe clearance technique immediately before tilting. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation could not be calculated in 13 preterm infants, as the blood volume remained constant during tilting. In the remaining 19, cerebral venous oxygen saturation averaged 0.67 (SD = 0.09) in asphyxiated infants and 0.53 (SD = 0.15) in preterm infants (p = 0.03). The corresponding values of cerebral blood flow were closely and inversely related to oxygen extraction calculated from cerebral venous saturation as estimated by near infrared spectroscopy.},

The relationship between NIRS and quantitative aEEG/EEG parameters has not yet been investigated. Our aim was to study the association between oxygen utilization during the first 6 h after birth and simultaneously continuously monitored brain activity measured by aEEG/EEG. Forty-four hemodynamically stable babies with a GA {$<$} 28 weeks, with good quality NIRS and aEEG/EEG data available and who did not receive morphine were included in the study. aEEG and NIRS monitoring started at NICU admission. The relation between regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE), and quantitative measurements of brain activity such as number of spontaneous activity transients (SAT) per minute (SAT rate), the interval in seconds (i.e. time) between SATs (ISI) and the minimum amplitude of the EEG in {$\mu$}V (min aEEG) were evaluated. rScO2 was negatively associated with SAT rate ({$\beta$}=-3.45 [CI=-5.76- -1.15], p=0.004) and positively associated with ISI ({$\beta$}=1.45 [CI=0.44-2.45], p=0.006). cFTOE was positively associated with SAT rate ({$\beta$}=0.034 [CI=0.009-0.059], p=0.008) and negatively associated with ISI ({$\beta$}=-0.015 [CI=-0.026- -0.004], p=0.007). Oxygen delivery and utilization, as indicated by rScO2 and cFTOE, are directly related to functional brain activity, expressed by SAT rate and ISI during the first hours after birth, showing an increase in oxygen extraction in preterm infants with increased early electro-cerebral activity. NIRS monitored oxygenation may be a useful biomarker of brain vulnerability in high-risk infants.},

This approach is possible because R               2               is directly affected by changes in CBF, CBV, CMRO               2               , and hematocrit (Hct), a phenomena better known as the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. Changes in CBF and CBV were accomplished by altering the carbon dioxide pressure, Paco               2               , over a range from 20 to 140 mm Hg. For each Paco               2               value, R               2               in gray and white matter were determined using MRI, and the whole-brain oxygen extraction ratio was obtained from arteriovenous differences (sagittal sinus catheter). Assuming a constant CMRO               2               , the microvascular CBV was obtained from an exact fit to the BOLD theory for the spin-echo effect. The resulting CBV values at normal Paco               2               and normalized to a common total hemoglobin concentration of 6.88 mmol/L were 42 {\textpm}18 {$\mu$}L/g (n = 7) and 29 {\textpm}19 {$\mu$}L/g (n = 5) for gray and white matter, respectively, in good agreement with the range of literature values published using independent methodologies. The present study confirms the validity of the spin-echo BOLD theory and, in addition, shows that blood volume can be quantified from the magnetic resonance imaging spin relaxation rate R               2               using a regulated carbon dioxide experiment.},

Here we examine the hypothesis that these children have altered myelin maturational that can be detected by myelin sensitive MRI measures prior to school age. We included 33 four-year old children born VPT (mean GA; 28.7\,weeks) and 23 four-year old full term (FT) children and completed magnetization transfer (MT), T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2-weighted (T1-w) magnetic resonance imaging as well as developmental assessments. Both MT ratio (MTR) and T1-w/T2-w ratio images were calculated, and group differences were probed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in white matter, and region of interest (ROI) analysis in white, subcortical gray and cortical gray matter. The relations between MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio, as well as with developmental assessments, were investigated in all three brain divisions. In children born VPT, TBSS and ROI analysis revealed that both MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio were significantly reduced in white matter compared to children born FT. ROI analysis showed reductions in T1-w/T2-w ratio in VPT children compared to FT children in the thalamus, putamen and amygdala, as well as in the occipital and temporal lobes. Across the VPT and FT children, T1-w/T2-w ratio and MTR were highly correlated across white, subcortical gray and cortical gray matter. Both measures correlated positively with developmental assessments in individual white matter tracts and cortical and subcortical ROIs, suggesting that higher MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio is related to better cognitive performance. Together these findings are consistent with delayed myelination in VPT born children.},

  abstract = {Early brain development, from the embryonic period to infancy, is characterized by rapid structural and functional changes. These changes can be studied using structural and physiological neuroimaging methods. In order to optimally acquire and accurately interpret this data, concepts from adult neuroimaging cannot be directly transferred. Instead, one must have a basic understanding of fetal and neonatal structural and physiological brain development, and the important modulators of this process. Here, we first review the major developmental milestones of transient cerebral structures and structural connectivity (axonal connectivity) followed by a summary of the contributions from ex vivo and in vivo MRI. Next, we discuss the basic biology of neuronal circuitry development (synaptic connectivity, i.e. ensemble of direct chemical and electrical connections between neurons), physiology of neurovascular coupling, baseline metabolic needs of the fetus and the infant, and functional connectivity (defined as statistical dependence of low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations seen with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)). The complementary roles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are discussed. We include a section on modulators of brain development where we focus on the placenta and emerging placental MRI approaches. In each section we discuss key technical limitations of the imaging modalities and some of the limitations arising due to the biology of the system. Although neuroimaging approaches have contributed significantly to our understanding of early brain development, there is much yet to be done and a dire need for technical innovations and scientific discoveries to realize the future potential of early fetal and infant interventions to avert long term disease.},

  abstract = {Children born preterm and of very low birth weight are at increased risk of learning difficulties and educational under-achievement. However, little is known about the specific neuropsychological problems facing these children or their neurological basis. Using prospective longitudinal data from a regional cohort of 92 preterm and 103 full-term children, this study examined relations between term MRI measures of cerebral injury and structural brain development and children's subsequent performance on an object working memory task at the age of 2 years. Results revealed clear between-group differences, with preterm children having greater difficulty encoding new information in working memory than term control children. Within the preterm group, task performance at the age of 2 years was related to both qualitative MRI measures of white matter (WM) injury and quantitative measures of total and regional brain volumes assessed at term equivalent. Bilateral reductions in total tissue volumes (\%region) of the following cerebral regions were specifically related to subsequent working memory performance: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor, parietooccipital and premotor. Associations between total cerebral tissue volumes at term (adjusted and unadjusted for intracranial volume) persisted even after the effects of WM injury were taken into account. This suggests that early disturbance in cerebral development may have an independent adverse impact on later working memory function in the preterm infant. These findings add to our understanding of the neuropathological pathways associated with later executive dysfunction in the very preterm infant.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with preterm birth are of major health and educational concern. This study examined the neuromotor, cognitive, language and emotional/behavioural outcomes of a regional cohort of 4-year-old children born extremely preterm (EPT: 23-27 weeks' gestation), very preterm (VPT: 28-33 weeks) and full term (FT: 38-41 weeks). Of particular interest were children's risks of impairment across multiple neurodevelopmental domains. METHODS: Data were gathered as part of a prospective longitudinal study of 105 very preterm ({$<$} or = 33 weeks gestation) and 107 FT children born during 1998-2000. At 4 years corrected age, children underwent a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment that included a paediatric neurological examination, cognitive and language testing, and an assessment of child emotional and behavioural adjustment. RESULTS: At age 4 years, compared to FT children, EPT and VPT children had increased risks of cerebral palsy (EPT 18\%, VPT 15\%, FT 1\%), cognitive delay (EPT 33\%, VPT 36\%, FT 13\%), language delay (EPT 29\%, VPT 29\%, FT 10\%) and emotional/behavioural adjustment problems (EPT 37\%, VPT 13\%, FT 11\%). EPT and VPT children were three times more likely to have multiple domain impairments than FT children (EPT 30\%, VPT 29\%, FT 10\%). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of preschool children born very preterm show clinically significant problems in at least one neurodevelopmental domain, with impairment in multiple domains being common. There is a need to monitor preschool development across a range of functional domains and to consider the likely cascading effects of multiple impairments on later development.},

We have therefore obtained the cytochrome aa3 spectrum in vivo from the brains of rats after replacing the blood with a fluorocarbon substitute. Near infrared haemoglobin spectra were also obtained, at various oxygenation levels, from cuvette studies of lysed human red blood cells. Estimates of optical path length have been obtained. The data were used to construct an algorithm for calculating the changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin and oxygenated cytochrome aa3 in tissue from changes in near IR absorption.},

  abstract = {Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is an important marker for brain function and brain health. Existing techniques for quantification of CMRO2 with positron emission tomography (PET) or MRI involve special equipment and/or exogenous agents, and may not be suitable for routine clinical studies. In the present study, a noninvasive method is developed to estimate whole-brain CMRO2 in humans. This method applies phase-contrast MRI for quantitative blood flow measurement and T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) MRI for venous oxygenation estimation, and uses the Fick principle of arteriovenous difference for the calculation of CMRO2. Whole-brain averaged CMRO2 values in young, healthy subjects were 132.1 {\textpm} 20.0 {$\mu$}mol/100 g/min, in good agreement with literature reports using PET. Various acquisition strategies for phase-contrast and TRUST MRI were compared, and it was found that nongated phase-contrast and sagittal sinus (SS) TRUST MRI were able to provide the most efficient and accurate estimation of CMRO2. In addition, blood flow and venous oxygenation were found to be positively correlated across subjects. Owing to the noninvasive nature of this method, it may be a convenient and useful approach for assessment of brain metabolism in brain disorders as well as under various physiologic conditions.

  abstract = {Measurements of cerebral oxygen consumption (CVO2) may improve our understanding of cerebral oxygenation, but there are few published data for sick neonates. Although cerebral maturation is associated with an increase in cerebral glucose consumption, the relationship between CVO2 and increasing gestational age has not previously been assessed in humans. The aims of this study were to evaluate a noninvasive method for the estimation of CVO2 in the neonate using near infrared spectroscopy, and to investigate the relationship between gestational age and CVO2. Twenty babies who were undergoing intensive care in the neonatal period were studied. Cerebral hemoglobin flow (CHbF) and cerebral venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (CSVO2) were measured using near infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was measure by pulse oximetry (SpO2). CVO2 was calculated from the equation: CVO2=CHbF x (SpO2 - SvO2 x 4. The median (range) CVO2 was 0.9 (0.52-1.76) mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1). There was an increase in CVO2 with advancing gestational age (n=20, p=0.55, p=0.014). We conclude that CVO2 can be estimated in sick neonates using noninvasive optical methods. The values obtained are similar to those obtained in other studies by more invasive methods, and are in agreement with values which would be expected from the known rate of cerebral glucose consumption in neonates. Mean (SD) CVO2 at 24-26 wk was 0.5 (0.18) mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1) and rose with increasing gestation to term by 0.03 mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1) per wk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is difficult to distinguish punctate white matter lesions from focal hemorrhagic lesions in neonates on conventional MR imaging because both kinds of lesions show increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and, frequently, decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Our aim was to distinguish punctate white matter lesions and focal hemorrhagic lesions using quantitative measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, we acquired multiecho gradient recalled-echo MR imaging data from 24 neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and postprocessed them as R2* relaxation maps and quantitative susceptibility maps. Seven subjects who were found to have multifocal punctate white matter lesions and/or focal hemorrhagic lesions on R2* maps were included (mean gestational age at birth, 33 {\textpm} 4.28 weeks; mean gestational age at scanning, 38 {\textpm} 2 weeks). Manually drawing ROIs on R2* maps, we measured R2* and magnetic susceptibility values of the lesions, along with white matter regions within the corpus callosum as healthy comparison tissue. RESULTS: R2* and magnetic susceptibility values were both found to easily distinguish punctate white matter lesions, focal hemorrhagic lesions, and healthy white matter tissue from each other (P {$<$} .05), with a large Hedge g. R2* and magnetic susceptibility values were significantly increased in focal hemorrhagic lesions compared with punctate white matter lesions and healthy white matter tissue. Punctate white matter lesions were also found to have significantly increased values over healthy white matter tissue. CONCLUSIONS: R2* and quantitative susceptibility maps can be used to help clinicians distinguish and measure focal hemorrhages, punctate white matter lesions, and healthy white matter tissue.},
